Create an Arkanoid/Breakout clone in 3D.

Baseline requirements:
[R1]			You’re looking into the “prison” cube.
[R2]			You have semi transparent “square” paddle to move around the
backwall.
[R3]			Game ends after you break everything out!
[R4]			4 different models to hit (2 generic, 1 is for power ups, 1 is for power
downs),
[R5]			1 power up, e.g.:
Multi-ball - all ball multiplies
Big balls - balls are bigger and strikes more
Strike-through - ball immediately destroys an object hit
[R6]			1 power down, e.g.:
Faster-ball - balls fly faster
Shrink-ball - balls get smaller and strikes less
Insta-ball-gib - destroys the ball that touches this
[R7]			Background music,
[R8]			some sound effects.
[R9]			Some explosion using particle effects.
[R10]			UI counting your scores, lives, level number.
[R11]			3 playable levels.

Advanced (extra) requirements:
[E1]			Some skybox behind.
[E2]			Each model has 3 different textures to be used with.
[E3]			+2 different power ups, e.g.:
Multi-ball - all ball multiplies
Big balls - balls are bigger and strikes more
Strike-through - ball immediately destroys an object hit
[E4]			+2 different power downs, e.g.:
Faster-ball - balls fly faster
Shrink-ball - balls get smaller and strikes less
Insta-ball-gib - destroys the ball that touches this
[E5]			Path after the balls is traced.
[E6]			Shatter things to triangles, inspiration.
[E7]			Screen “shakes” when the ball hits your paddle.
