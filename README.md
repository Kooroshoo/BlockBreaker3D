<li>[R3]			Game ends after you break everything out!</li>
<li>[R4]			4 different models to hit (2 generic, 1 is for power ups, 1 is for power downs),</li>
<li>[R5]			1 power up, e.g.: Multi-ball - all ball multiplies, Big balls - balls are bigger and strikes more, Strike-through - ball immediately destroys an object hit</li>
<li>[R6]			1 power down, e.g.: Faster-ball - balls fly faster, Shrink-ball - balls get smaller and strikes less, Insta-ball-gib - destroys the ball that touches this</li>
<li>[R7]			Background music,</li>
<li>[R8]			some sound effects.</li>
<li>[R9]			Some explosion using particle effects.</li>
<li>[R10]			UI counting your scores, lives, level number.</li>

<li>[E4]			+2 different power downs, e.g.: Faster-ball - balls fly faster, Shrink-ball - balls get smaller and strikes less, Insta-ball-gib - destroys the ball that touches this</li>
<li>[E5]			Path after the balls is traced.</li>
